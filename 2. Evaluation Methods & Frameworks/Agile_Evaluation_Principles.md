# Agile Evaluation â€“ Principles & Approach

Agile Evaluation applies iterative, flexible, and stakeholder-responsive practices to evaluation design and reporting.

## Key Features
- **Rapid feedback loops:** Quick cycles of data collection and action
- **Collaborative development:** Stakeholders involved throughout
- **Adaptive reporting:** Results shared incrementally
- **Continuous improvement:** Findings applied in real-time

This model works well in fast-paced environments, such as tech or agile instructional design, where traditional models may be too slow or rigid.

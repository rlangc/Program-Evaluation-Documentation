# CIPP Model Overview â€“ Context, Input, Process, Product

Developed by Daniel Stufflebeam, the CIPP Model is a comprehensive framework for evaluating programs at every stage.

- **Context Evaluation:** Assesses needs, problems, and opportunities.
- **Input Evaluation:** Examines strategy, resources, and action plans.
- **Process Evaluation:** Monitors implementation and operational quality.
- **Product Evaluation:** Determines short- and long-term outcomes and impacts.

The model is particularly useful for formative and summative evaluations in education, government, and nonprofit sectors.

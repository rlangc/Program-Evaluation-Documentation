# Goal-Free Evaluation Overview

Goal-Free Evaluation (GFE), introduced by Michael Scriven, evaluates a program without reference to its stated goals.

## Key Characteristics
- Focuses on actual outcomes and effects, not intended objectives
- Reduces confirmation bias and tunnel vision
- Involves open-ended data collection and inductive analysis

GFE is useful for uncovering unintended effects, both positive and negative, and complements goal-oriented evaluations.

# Visualizing Data for Evaluation Reports

Data visualization helps stakeholders quickly grasp complex information.

## Best Practices
- Choose the right chart for the data (e.g., bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for proportions)
- Use consistent colors and labels
- Include titles, axes, and data sources

## Examples
- Satisfaction levels across departments → Bar chart
- Pre- and post-training score comparison → Line or column chart
- Thematic frequency of qualitative codes → Word cloud or frequency bar chart

## Tools to Try
- Excel or Google Sheets (basic charts)
- Power BI or Tableau (advanced dashboards)
- Word Cloud Generators for qualitative data

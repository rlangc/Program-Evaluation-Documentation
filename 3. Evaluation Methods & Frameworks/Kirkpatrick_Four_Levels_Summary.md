# Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Evaluation – Summary

Kirkpatrick’s model is a foundational evaluation framework used to assess the effectiveness of training programs across four levels:

1. **Reaction** – Measures participant satisfaction and engagement immediately after training.
2. **Learning** – Assesses the increase in knowledge, skills, or attitudes.
3. **Behavior** – Evaluates how well learners apply new skills in the workplace.
4. **Results** – Analyzes the overall impact on business or organizational performance.

This tiered structure helps organizations track the effectiveness of learning initiatives from participant perception to ROI.

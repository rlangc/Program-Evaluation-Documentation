# Logic Model Basics

Logic models provide a structured way to visualize the relationships between resources, activities, outputs, and outcomes.

## Components
- **Inputs:** Resources invested (staff, time, funding)
- **Activities:** Actions or tasks carried out (training, outreach)
- **Outputs:** Direct products (number of sessions, materials created)
- **Outcomes:** Short-, medium-, and long-term changes (knowledge gain, behavior change, societal impact)

Logic models are often used in program planning and evaluation to align activities with intended results.

This collection features a blend of academic research, practical tools, and real-world project samples that demonstrate how evaluation principles are applied across diverse learning environments. From foundational theory to applied mixed-method evaluations, the materials represent evolving expertise in formative, summative, and continuous improvement processes.

Each artifact in the repository reflects a commitment to data-informed decision-makingâ€”whether through the use of recognized frameworks like Kirkpatrick and CIPP, the creation of survey instruments and analysis tools, or the writing of detailed evaluation reports.
